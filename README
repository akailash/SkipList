Project on Skip List
======================
CS401 - IIT-C
Team 8

Creation of skiplist using probability to generate the list (with 100% elements at lowest level, followed by 10% of that in nxt level and 20% of that in next level and 50% of that in highest level, as specified in project.). A test class implemented. Currently it just shows a crude diagram of the list we generated.

Search is not implemented.

Code needs to be debugged and comments need to be added everywhere. Show structure method needs to be refined to be useful.
