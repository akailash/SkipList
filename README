Project on Skip List
======================
CS401 - IIT-C
Team 8

Creation of skiplist using probability to generate the list (with 100% elements at lowest level, followed by 10% of that in nxt level and 20% of that in next level and 50% of that in highest level, as specified in project.). The number of elements specified in the project requirements at each level is taken as the upper bound.

Since the linked list can be simulated by looking at a skip list with only the lowest level, we simulate the linked list performance for search using only the lowest level of the skiplist.
